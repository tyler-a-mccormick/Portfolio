## **🔍 Project Highlights**

### **1️⃣ Geospatial Analysis (`city_distance.py`, `city_distance.R`)**
- Calculates **geodesic distances** between a list of **communities** and **cities**.
- Uses the **Haversine formula** to find nearby locations within a **user-defined radius**.
- Outputs results to a **CSV file** for further analysis.

**_Use Case:_**  
📍 A real estate firm wants to identify **the closest urban centers** to its senior living communities for **better service planning**.

### **2️⃣ Machine Learning: Feature Importance (`random_forest_importance.py`)**
- Uses **Random Forest classification** to identify the most influential features in a dataset.
- **Evaluates marketing campaigns** by analyzing digital ad factors (e.g., source, medium, campaign type).
- Produces a **feature importance plot** for data-driven decision-making.

**_Use Case:_**  
📊 A marketing team needs to **prioritize ad spend** by identifying the **most effective channels** for conversions.

---

### **3️⃣ SQL Automation: Calendar Table (`calendar_table.sql`)**
- Generates a **date dimension table** for **business intelligence dashboards**.
- Supports **joins** with transactional data, enabling **trend analysis by year, month, quarter, and day**.

**_Use Case:_**  
📅 A finance team needs a structured **date table** to **track revenue trends over time**.
